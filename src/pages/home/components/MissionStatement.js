            <p className="w-[60vw] text-center">Modern slavery is a result of social, cultural, and political conditions that make people vulnerable. Poverty, war and conflict, migration, lack of access to basic human rights, and many other related factors create conditions where the powerful have the opportunity to oppress and exploit the weak.</p>
            <br />
            <p className="w-[60vw] text-center">Our mission is to combat human trafficking by providing a comprehensive platform for awareness, prevention, and data-driven action. We aim to empower individuals and communities with knowledge, resources, and support to recognize and resist trafficking, while also facilitating the collection and analysis of data to inform targeted interventions. Through collaboration, education, and advocacy, we strive to create a world where every person is free from exploitation and able to live with dignity and autonomy.</p>
